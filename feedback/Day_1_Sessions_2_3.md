# Feedback for SWC at SFU June 2013

## Intro to git with shell (Day 1, Session 2)

**Good**

* VC very useful
* git exploration was great!
* cool concepts and lesson


**Bad**

* way too fast!
* confusing b/c everyone was progressing at different speeds.
* process one step at a time and wait for everyone to catch up.
* commands entry sometimes too fast.


** Suggestions **

* Have printed version of lesson so that we can catch up.


## git with SmartGit GUI (Day 1, Session 3)

**Good**

* Funny instructor
* Thanks for doing this! Great job!
* Good pace.

**Bad**

* Combination between shell and smartgit sometimes confusing.
* Had problems following the unix commands to create the files [editor: shell scripts that were commited later] that were then used with Git. Maybe use simple text changes to files with Git to make it easier to follow along.
* Should not run over time.
* Need to go faster so that I am paying more attention.

** Suggestions **

* Draw more parallels between command line processes of morning session and smartgit?
* Use two projectors: Second screen with notes for those who are half a step behind. (At least have someone writing keynotes into etherpad, so people can check it if they need to.)
